            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How do patterns of corporate ownership vary across different neighborhoods?</li>
                <li>How has corporate ownership in Boston changed over time, and how do crises like the 2008 recession and the Covid-19 pandemic correlate with shifts in corporate ownership patterns?</li>
                <li>Is there observable spatial clustering of areas with high rates of corporate housing ownership?</li>
                <li>How does corporate ownership intersect with race and child vulnerability? Are neighborhoods with higher proportions of non-white children more likely to have higher corporate ownership rates?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Motivation Behind Questions</h3>
            <p>
                I am a volunteer journalist for a newspaper in Boston’s Chinatown. Through reporting in the neighborhood, I have learned from talking to local community leaders and residents how the recent growth in luxury development is causing demographic shifts that pose an existential threat to the neighborhood’s historic status as an ethnic community of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Today, these populations are being displaced as a wealthier clientele capable of paying luxury rents moves in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinatown has historically faced existential threats during the highway developments of the mid-20th century and continues to experience displacement pressures due to gentrification -- an example of how planning decisions have long been used as tools of exclusion. After reading Heather Vogell’s ProPublica article, <em>"When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord,"</em> I suspect that similar patterns of historic and ongoing exclusion through corporate ownership and displacement are taking place in other communities as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an urban planner, I am interested in the histories revealed in the visibilization of the spatial fingerprints that corporate landlords are leaving on the city. Given that the dataset on corporate ownership rates spans 20 years, I anticipate that temporal patterns will emerge, revealing how corporate ownership has expanded and either preceded or followed demographic shifts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the connection between gentrification and corporate ownership is important because, contrary to what many believe, displacement and gentrification are not inevitable processes. They are facilitated and, at times, actively incentivized through financial mechanisms, policies, and the absence of regulation. These ideas are explored in depth by Leslie Kern in a book I recently enjoyed reading, <em>Gentrification Is Inevitable and Other Lies.</em>

            <h3>Data Source</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset used for this Exploratory Visual Analysis is titled "Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census". It was provided by the 6.C85 Spring 2025 teaching team for the purpose of facilitating Assignment 2. It consists of data from the City of Boston and the US Census Bureau, and describes changes over time between 2004 and 2024 in corporate ownership rates and owner occupany rates within Boston neighborhoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that certain Boston geographies are missing from this dataset: Back Bay and Mission Hill were not included in the source dataset.

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>
            This chart examines the average corporate ownership rates across Boston (y-axis) over a 20-year period (2004–2024, x-axis). It reveals a clear trend of increasing corporate ownership of Boston’s housing stock. In 2004, 5.5% of the housing stock in the average included neighborhood was controlled by corporate landlords. By 2024, this rate had surged to 25.3%. The graph highlights an acceleration in corporate ownership rates beginning in 2018, with a sharp increase during the pandemic years (2020–2022).

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>
            While corporate ownership rates have increased in every neighborhood included in this dataset, in some neighborhoods, the rate of corporate takeover has been more extreme than in others. For instance, in <strong>West Roxbury</strong>, corporate ownership rates grew from <strong>1% in 2004 to 13% in 2024</strong>. This is a significant increase, but less dramatic than in the <strong>South Boston Waterfront</strong> neighborhood, where corporate ownership rates rose from <strong>6% in 2004 to 38% in 2024</strong>.

        <h4>Key Patterns:</h4>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Corporate landlords may prefer expanding in areas where they already have a presence.</strong>  
            Neighborhoods with lower corporate ownership levels in 2004 tend to have lower rates in 2024. This suggests that corporate landlords may focus on growing their footprint in neighborhoods where they are already established or in areas with characteristics that support their business models. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Corporate ownership fluctuates in response to economic crises.</strong>  
            Some neighborhoods have seen large spikes and dips in corporate ownership rates—notably, the pink peaks in <strong>2010 and 2022</strong> in South Boston Waterfront. These peaks align with the periods immediately following the <strong>2008 financial crisis</strong> and the <strong>Covid-19 pandemic</strong>. This pattern suggests large-scale buying and selling of properties during economic downturns, which can <strong>drive up property prices</strong>.

            Charting data filtered to include only values from 2004, with owner occupancy rates on the y-axis and corporate ownership rates on the x-axis, reveals a clear relationship between these two factors: higher levels of owner occupancy are correlated with lower rates of corporate ownership.

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>
            Charting the same data filtered for 2024 reveals that the same pattern has persisted over the past 20 years. Owner occupancy rates have declined in every neighborhood, while corporate ownership rates have increased. However, the relationship between the two variables remains the same.
            It makes sense that neighborhoods with higher homeownership rates are less likely to experience large-scale corporate purchases. However, this trend raises equity concerns. White Americans have historically had greater access to homeownership due to discriminatory policies such as redlining, exclusionary zoning, and unequal access to credit. This raises the question: are predominantly non-white neighborhoods more vulnerable to corporate home buying?

            Moving the slider to look at data from 2004 through 2024 tells a mesmerizing yet disturbing story of dispossession in Boston. Mapping corporate ownership rates across neighborhoods shows the clear spatial clustering of corporate-owned housing, concentrated around South Boston and Downtown but spreading further into the city, including Allston-Brighton. In the map format, the missing neighborhood data (Back Bay and Mission Hill) stands out more visibly as data gaps.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigating the data over time tells a similar story to what’s revealed in the previous charts. Starting in 2010, corporate ownership rates began breaching 10-15% in South Boston and Downtown. Corporate ownership rates surged starting around 2020 around the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, growing rapidly in South Boston and Downtown and spreading into Roxbury and Allston, two neighborhoods that, from anecdotal evidence, are experiencing gentrification. Seeing private control of the housing market expand in response to economic shocks (i.e., the recession and pandemic) suggests a broader strategy of market capitalization in the wake of catastrophe—which, of course, points to ongoing and worsening patterns of exploitation.

            Putting 2020 Census data in conversation with 2024 corporate ownership data could reveal patterns of exposure to corporate landlords shaped by race. This chart represents population size (circle size) and corporate ownership rates (brighter color = more exposure), mapped in a tabular format with Census race groups along the top and neighborhoods along the side.

                Immediately, it's clear that certain neighborhoods, like Fenway, have large populations of non-white residents and high corporate ownership rates. While this visual is engaging and encourages users to interact with the data more intentionally, clear findings do not immediately stand out due to the large number of data points being visualized.

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>
            A question I wanted to answer was: to what degree, and where, are children exposed to corporate landlords? To me, this is a question tied to gender and racial equity, since Black mothers are one of the most vulnerable demographics to evictions (Center for American Progress).
        </p>
                <p>
                    Charting neighborhoods by the percentage of their population under the age of 18 in 2020 against corporate ownership rates in 2024 shows a visible relationship where higher proportions of children in a neighborhood tend to be associated with lower corporate ownership rates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the neighborhoods with high proportions of children are located further from the city center, where the housing stock is more likely to consist of single-family homes. Also, Boston’s city center has a large number of universities and young professionals, meaning likely fewer residents with children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be interesting to look at 2000 Census data to see if this pattern of very few children making up city center populations is actually the result of rising home costs associated with increasing corporate ownership.

                        Finally, how does race impact children’s exposure to corporate landlords? In this chart, the proportion of under-18 populations for the four largest racial demographics in Boston is shown as a percentage of the total child population for each neighborhood, with color used to highlight areas with high corporate ownership rates in 2024.

                    <p>
                        In this visualization, certain neighborhoods stand out as areas with both high proportions of specific racial demographics among children and high corporate ownership rates. Notably:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chinatown</strong> has a very high proportion of Asian children and a very high rate of corporate ownership.</li>
                        <li><strong>East Boston</strong> has a high proportion of Black children and a high corporate ownership rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Longwood</strong> has a relatively high proportion of non-white children and high corporate ownership rates.</li>

    <h3>Main Learnings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Corporate ownership in Boston has accelerated in recent years.</strong>  
            While corporate ownership remains spatially clustered in certain neighborhoods, the footprint of areas with more than 20% corporate-owned housing is expanding beyond the city center.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Some neighborhoods are more impacted than others.</strong>  
            Neighborhoods with high owner occupancy rates tend to have lower levels of corporate ownership. This pattern was visible in both 2004 and 2024, suggesting a persistent relationship over time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Neighborhoods with high proportions of children tend to have lower corporate ownership rates.</strong>  
            However, since this analysis only includes 2020 Census data, I cannot determine whether child population patterns have shifted as corporate ownership rates have increased over the years.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Corporate ownership is a key factor in Boston’s affordable housing crisis.</strong>  
            The data makes it clear that corporate ownership is expanding rapidly and that certain companies are profiting from the increasing financialization of housing.
