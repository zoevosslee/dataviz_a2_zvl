            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Where are corporately owned housing units most concentrated, and how do these patterns vary across different neighborhoods?</li>
                <li>How has the prevalence of corporate-owned housing changed over time, and what factors have influenced these shifts?</li>
                <li>What is the relationship between corporate ownership and vacancy rates in different housing markets?</li>
                <li>To what extent are children in Boston exposed to corporate-owned housing, and how does this exposure vary by neighborhood and demographic group?</li>
                <li>How does corporate ownership influence demographic shifts in communities over time, particularly in relation to displacement and gentrification?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Motivation Behind Questions</h3>
            <p>
                I am a volunteer journalist for a newspaper in Boston’s Chinatown. Through reporting in the neighborhood, I have learned from talking to local community leaders and residents how the recent growth in luxury development in the area is causing demographic shifts that pose an existential threat to the neighborhood’s historic status as an ethnic community of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Today, these populations are declining as a wealthier clientele capable of paying luxury rents moves in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Chinatown has historically faced existential threats during the highway developments of the mid-20th century and continues to experience displacement pressures due to gentrification—an example of how planning decisions have long been used as tools of exclusion. After reading Heather Vogell’s ProPublica article, <em>"When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord,"</em> I suspect that similar patterns of historic and ongoing exclusion through corporate ownership and displacement are taking place in other communities as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an urban planner, I am interested in the histories revealed in the visibilization of the spatial fingerprints that corporate landlords are leaving on the city. Given that the dataset on corporate ownership rates spans 20 years, I anticipate that temporal patterns will emerge, revealing how corporate ownership has expanded and either preceded or followed demographic shifts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the connection between gentrification and corporate ownership is important because, contrary to what many believe, displacement and gentrification are not inevitable processes. They are facilitated and, at times, actively incentivized through financial mechanisms, policies, and the absence of regulation. These ideas are explored in depth by Leslie Kern in a book I recently enjoyed reading, <em>Gentrification Is Inevitable and Other Lies.</em>

            <h3>Data Source</h3>
            <p>
                The dataset used for this Exploratory Visual Analysis is titled "Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census". It was provided by the 6.C85 Spring 2025 teaching team for the purpose of facilitating Assignment 2. It consists of data from the City of Boston and the US Census Bureau, and describes changes over time between 2004 and 2024 in corporate ownership rates and owner occupany rates within Boston neighborhoods.
